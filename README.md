# wordpress-blog-post-with-python

WordPress is one of the most popular and widely-used tools to create blogs, e-commerce platforms, and websites.

I'll show you how to create content automatically and push it to your WordPress website with Python.

This is how it works:

    We'll get content from our source (for example, another website we run)
    We'll translate it into our language
    We'll choose a featured image already available on our website and finally publish it to our WordPress instance as a post.
